**Summary**
Early detection of the influenza outbreaks is one of the biggest challenges of outbreak surveillance systems. In this paper, a finite, homogeneous two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was developed to determine the epidemic and non-epidemic dynamics influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in a dierenced time series. These dynamics were further modeled via a first-order auto-regressive process based on the state, and parameters estimated via the Baum-Welch
algorithm. The model was evaluated with US ILI data from 1998-2018.
